# MonoRepo Starter

A modern, ESM-only monorepo starter built from scratch using the latest tooling:

- 🧱 **pnpm workspaces** for dependency management  
- ⚡ **Turborepo** for build orchestration  
- 🧪 **TypeScript** with strict settings  
- 🛠️ **Vite 6** for blazing-fast dev and build  
- 🌈 **Tailwind CSS 4** via `@tailwindcss/vite`  
- ⚛️ **React 19** with automatic runtime  
- 📦 Shared packages: `@my/ui` and `@my/utils`

> This is a from-scratch setup with zero legacy overhead — designed to power design systems, app frontends, tooling, and future dapps.
